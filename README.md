# DC-DC-Converter-Designs

Here there are 2 DC-DC Converters that I designed and tested during the 2nd year of my participation in the Formula Student Team, Aristotle University Racing Team Electric - ARISTURTLE.

### 600V Input, 24V Output, 25A max current DC-DC

This is the DC-DC Converter that powers the entire Low Votage System of the car. It takes a high voltage input from the Battery Pack and gives 24V for the supply of the LV System.

### 600V Input, 12V Output, 200mA max current DC-DC

This is the DC-DC Converter that powers the led indicator of the Battery Pack that shows if the voltage of the Battery Pack (in the side of the vehicle) is more than 60V. This is a Test PCB and not the final one, since the final PCB is integrated in the Fusebox PCB which is in a different repository.
